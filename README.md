**Bid Idea**

Create a financial dashboard that conducts fundamental and technical analysis for every company in the S&P500.

**Learning Goals**

The learning objectives are developing proficiency in Python programming, data analysis, and learning scraping techniques to interact with websites and parse data. I also want to improve my text analysis skills using python through enhanced data cleaning. 

**Implementation Plan**

Look through finance APIs on the web and choose a suitable one that a simple user interface. Thereafter, read through the documentation to understand how the API functions. 

**Risks**

Risk of not being able to obtain reliable real-time data or not having the ability to understand the structure of the code through the documentation.
